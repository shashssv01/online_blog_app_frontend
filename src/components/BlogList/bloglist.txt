useEffect: A React Hook that runs side effects (e.g., API calls, DOM manipulation) after the component renders. 
Here, it's used to fetch data when the component mounts.

fetchData: An asynchronous function defined within the useEffect hook to fetch data from an API.

setIsLoading(true): Sets the isLoading state to true to indicate that the data is being fetched, triggering the loading state.

try {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');

try: Starts a block to handle potential errors that might occur during the fetch operation.
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'): Makes a GET request to the placeholder API to fetch a list of posts.
await: Ensures the code waits for the API response before proceeding to the next line.

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`Error: ${response.statusText}`);
}

response.ok: A boolean indicating whether the HTTP status code is in the range of 200-299 (success responses).
throw new Error: If the response is not OK (e.g., status 404), an error is thrown with a custom message (response.statusText contains the server's error message).

const result: ApiData[] = await response.json();
setData(result);
setError(null);

response.json(): Converts the JSON response body into a JavaScript object. The await ensures the operation is completed before proceeding.
result: Holds the parsed JSON data from the API response.
setData(result): Updates the data state with the fetched posts.
### setError(null): Resets the error state in case a previous error existed
